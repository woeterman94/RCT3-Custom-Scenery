            Klinn's Framework Custom RCT3 Building Set
================================================================

Introduction
============
This is collection of custom scenery objects primarily designed to be combined with RollerCoaster Tycoon 3's standard building sets. For various screen shots that help explain how the building set works and additional construction suggestions, please go to this site:

Custom scenery has only become possible thanks to the hard work of JonWil, who analyzed RCT3’s files and created utilities to import objects into the game. A huge round of applause should be sent his way.

One group of components is used to build girder frameworks, such as supports for laser screens. Yes, the screens are included too. The girders can be arranged in many other ways. They are designed to fit in between existing RCT3 walls, or to wrap around other wall sections. You can even add floor slabs right on top of the horizontal girders. These girders are about 1/2 the size of the ones in my ElectroShock set, so feel free to combine them to create even more exotic structures. 

Another group of components is used to build arched framework. There's a variety of parts to create freestanding arches in many sizes and heights. The pillar base, three heights of pillars, and three sizes of arches are all separate objects so you can mix'n'match them to suit your needs. Or build the arches right into existing RCT3 walls to give them a different style, or to frame a path or ride entrance into a building.

There are separate lintel pieces which can be used to extend an archway horizontally or even to make a rectangular opening. But don't stop there! The arches can be used for other things too, like the bridge supports. Go ahead - be bold!

Caution!
========
Creating and using custom RCT3 objects is still at the experimental stage. While these parts have been tested and should not cause any problems, by using them you are assuming all risk should something corrupt your Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 installation or your parks. Don’t expect any help from Atari or Frontier if things go bad, they will not support a game modified with third-party fan add-ons.

Uninstalling
============
If you ever get sick of these custom pieces, go to the Windows Control Panel and start the 'Add Or Remove Programs' applet. Click on 'Klinn's Framework Version 2' in the list to select it, then click the 'Remove' button.

Using the Custom Set
====================
The custom scenery has been updated to ensure it works with the RCT Wild! expansion pack, as well as the original game and the Soaked! expansion.

Start up a sandbox park or custom scenario and open the walls section of the scenery list. Make sure you don’t have the Generic theme filtered out, since that’s where my Framework items appears. Scroll down through the wall sets until you see ‘Klinn’s Framework’. Open it up and you’ll see the pieces included:

    - Arch Large - freestanding, spans a three-wide path.
    - Arch Large with Wall Filler - used with RCT3 walls.
    - Arch Medium - freestanding, spans a two-wide path.
    - Arch Medium with Wall Filler - used with RCT3 walls.
    - Arch Small - spans a single path, freestanding or used with walls.
    - Arch Column 1/3 Height - short column.
    - Arch Column 2/3 Height - medium height column.
    - Arch Column Full Height.
    - Arch Column Base - optional foot for columns.
    - Arch Lintel for Large & Small Arches - horizontal extension.
    - Arch Lintel for Medium Arches - horizontal extension for arch.
    - Arch Lintel Square Corner - use for non-arched frames.
    - Girder Square Horizontal - framework square crossmember.
    - Girder Square Vertical - framework square upright.
    - Girder Triangular Horizontal - triangular cross-section.
    - Girder Triangular Vertical - triangular cross-section.
    - Screen White - project laser shows on these.
    - Screen Recolourable - try a laser show on black screen.

As you select and place the custom objects, you’ll see a couple of differences compared to the normal RCT3 items.

First, while you’ll get a ghost image of the object itself, there’s no blue square on the ground to help you gauge its position. The vertical girders are designed to fit at the corner of regular walls. The laser screens are the same size as regular walls but like the girders, must be rotated with the 'Z' key.

Secondly, there is no collision detection - you can place the objects anywhere, even overlapping each other. This is what lets you place the framework right over existing RCT3 walls, or combine arches into many different patterns. The only downside is that it's harder to stack sections. They won’t jump up to the top of the previous one; you’ll have to raise them to the right height yourself.

The girders have been sized to fit in with RCT3's standard walls and platforms. While this means that the girders themselves can be overlapped in ways that can look a little odd, it was done to maximize the flexibility of the set while minimizing the number of pieces needed.

The regular arches work fine when creating freestanding arrangements. If you use them to frame an opening into a building, the curve of the two larger sizes leaves a gap between the upper corner of the arch and the regular squared-off RCT3 walls. There are two special arch pieces which have a filler section to close in that gap. The small arch can be used either freestanding or built into walls, it's only the medium and large arches which require these special versions.

All items in this custom scenery pack can be recoloured using the standard RCT3 tools. 

Known Issues
============
1. When positioning an item, there is no blue ghost square on the ground. Makes it tougher to place them, but see the previous section for tips on getting around this.

2. The screens aren’t true ‘wall’ objects in the sense that they don’t automatically flip around as you move them close to the edges of the ground grid squares. Since you can’t see the blue ghost square on the ground, that behaviour became confusing. Just use the regular ‘Z’ key to rotate them to the correct orientation, then place in position.

3. You can’t delete multiple items at once by using RCT3’s delete tool and highlighting all the squares they’re sitting on. You can still use the other delete tool and click on each piece individually, so it’s not too time consuming to clean up an area.

4. All icons in the Framework group have white backgrounds, not alternating white and grey. 

Making Your Own Custom Scenery
==============================
If you would like to try your hand at making custom scenery, be sure to visit the Atari RCT3 general forum and look for JonWil’s threads. They contain all the information you need to get started. Hopefully as the community builds up more experience, some tutorials will be written to help guide folks through the process.

Redistribution
==============
Please feel free to pass along this custom scenery, or to host it on your web site, so long as it is not done for profit

Acknowledgements
================
First and foremost, major props to JonWil, who somehow managed to decode much of RCT3’s file formats and create an incredibly useful Importer utility. If you want to learn how to build your own custom RCT3 objects, be sure to check out JonWil’s threads in the general Atari RCT3 forum.

Thanks as well to many of the Atari forum regulars who have been experimenting with custom objects and sharing their experiences and information. In particular, Pumper, Marnetmar, Guybrush, and Miss O have helped clarify many things that puzzled me. In addition, there are forum members too numerous to mention whose enthusiasm and interest in custom objects keep me plugging away at it.

And finally, thanks to Frontier and Atari for creating such a fascinating game that just keeps getting better!
